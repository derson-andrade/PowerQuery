# Sample connector for NASA APIs

This is a sample connector APIs listed at the [NASA API Portal](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html).
The sample currently connects to a single API ([Fireball](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Fireball)), but may be extended in the future to connect to other APIs.

Note that while most NASA APIs require the use of an [api_key](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#authentication), the Fireball API used in this sample does not.

*Functionality*
- Navigation table
- Multiple authentication types
- API Key based authentication with a default key
